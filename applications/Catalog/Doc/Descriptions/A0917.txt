Special Ducks Unlimited Traditions Canvas Collection Edition
The third image in Thomas Kinkade's <i>End of a Perfect Day</i> series
According to Kinkade, this image &#8220;Celebrates the majesty of God's<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;creation. A lovely stream in the distance invites us to explore or<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;fish; trails wind up and away to valleys and vistas we can only<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;imagine. In the drama of sunset, the woodsman returns to his<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;own small world: a cozy stone cabin warmed by a hearth fire and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the promise of comfort at day's end.&#8221
