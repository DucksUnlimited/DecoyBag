Second edition in the Retreat canvas series
Redlin's use of earthy colors, blazing sunrises and sunsets and<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;nostalgic themes are often cited for his immense popularity
Over the 17 year period from 1981 to 1997, Redin's donations to<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ducks Unlimited raised more than $28 million, setting an<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;all-time record in art sales for wetland conservation projects
