Concealment is the key when pursuing wary game and this Stoeger pump shotgun is easy to hide with it's Advantage HD Timber camouflage coating. Comprised of lightweight, composite materials, this 12 ga. weighs less than seven pounds.  Turkey hunters will appreciate the 24&#8221; barrel, 3 1/2&#8221; chamber, red bar sight, and extended extra full turkey choke.  A recoil-reducing butt pad absorbs punishment from the heaviest 12 ga. loads.  Gun lock, choke tubes (C, IC, M, F, XF Turkey) included.
